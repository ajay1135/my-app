### Background

Ever wondered what goes into an executable to get it to run? Unfortunately, it isn't as simple as writing machine code and pointing to an entrypoint. There's some amount of boilerplate that goes into getting an executable to run on a system. Even when dealing with completely static binaries (no dynamic linking), Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) binaries require some boilerplate in the form of headers. 

There are three different types of headers that I'll reference throughout this blog post. 

First is the ELF header, which stores some general information about the type of system, ABI, entrypoint, etc. 

The second is the program header table, which consists of a series of program headers. Each program header describes what's known as a segment, which is a portion of the ELF file with different permissions (like read, write, and execute) on them when loaded into memory. Segments contain the information that's needed for the runtime execution the process image corresponding to the program in the ELF file. 

And the last is the section header table. Each section header describes a section, which contains data for relocation and linking. 

Note that segments and sections can overlap. Multiple sections can belong to a single segment, and the same section can belong to multiple segments. Of course there's a lot more to it than what I described here, but this should be sufficient background for the rest of this blog post. 

### Starting Simple

Let's zoom out and start with a very simple "Hello World" program. In C, it may look something like: 
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("Hello, world!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

When you compile it and try to find the size of the resulting executable, you'll see something like the following (provided you're on a Linux x86-64 system): 
```bash
$ gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c
$ ls -l hello_world
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ajay users 15448 Jan 12 13:03 hello_world
```

That's a pretty large file for a very simple program! Let's try to reduce the size of the binary progressively. 

First, note that the binary is dynamically linked against glibc (we included `stdio.h` in our C program after all). You can find this using `ldd`: 
```bash
$ ldd hello_world
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ddebc0f2000)
        libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007ddebbed7000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007ddebc0f4000)
```

While the details are out of scope for this blog post, you can see that the binary is dynamically linked against glibc, as expected (`libc.so.6`). Additionally, the third line of the output is for the dynamic linker, while the first line is for a dynamic shared object that contains userspace implementations of some kernelspace routies, in an effort to optimize the number of context switches that the program needs to do (system calls incur a performance overhead due to context switches). 

### Inline Assembly

Let's create a completely static binary without using the standard library in an attempt to reduce its size. To do this, we can use the `write` system call directly, writing inline assembly in our C program: 
```C
#define __NR_write 1
#define __NR_exit 60

void _start() {
	const char* buf = "Hello, world!\n";
	int ret;

	// Write syscall
	asm volatile (
			"syscall"
			: "=a" (ret)
			: "0"(__NR_write), "D"(1), "S"(buf), "d"(15)
			: "rcx", "r11", "memory"
		     );

	// Exit syscall
	asm volatile (
			"syscall"
			:
			: "a"(__NR_exit), "D"(0)
			: "rcx", "r11", "memory"
		     );
}
```

Note that instead of having a `main` function, all of our code is written in the `_start` function instead. We do this because, the default linker script (we'll get into linker scripts a little later) looks for the `_start` symbol to use as the entrypoint to the program. When linking against the standard library, that symbol is added in for us. Eventually, the code path starting from the `_start` routine will call the `main` function that we would've defined in a traditional C program. 

Let's compile this program (in a file called `hello_world_no_stdlib.c`) and check how large our resulting executable is: 
```bash
$ gcc -static -nostdlib -o hello_world_static hello_world_no_stdlib.c 
$ ls -l hello_world_static
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ajay users 9232 Jan 12 13:14 hello_world_static
```

Well, at least we've reduced the size of the binary by a few thousand bytes. But it still feels like the binary is too large for just a simple "Hello World" program. At this point, it might be useful for us to get an idea of how large we expect a simple "Hello World" program to be, as opposed to just relying on intuition. 

Let's disassemble the binary and see what we find: 
```bash
$ objdump -d hello_world_no_stdlib -M intel

hello_world_no_stdlib:     file format elf64-x86-64


Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000401000 <_start>:
  401000:       55                      push   rbp
  401001:       48 89 e5                mov    rbp,rsp
  401004:       48 8d 05 f5 0f 00 00    lea    rax,[rip+0xff5]        # 402000 <_start+0x1000>
  40100b:       48 89 45 f8             mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax
  40100f:       b8 01 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x1
  401014:       bf 01 00 00 00          mov    edi,0x1
  401019:       48 8b 75 f8             mov    rsi,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
  40101d:       ba 0f 00 00 00          mov    edx,0xf
  401022:       0f 05                   syscall
  401024:       89 45 f4                mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],eax
  401027:       b8 3c 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x3c
  40102c:       ba 00 00 00 00          mov    edx,0x0
  401031:       89 d7                   mov    edi,edx
  401033:       0f 05                   syscall
  401035:       90                      nop
  401036:       5d                      pop    rbp
  401037:       c3                      ret
```

The above showcases the disassembly of the `.text` section (where our code lives), starting from the `_start` symbol. A conservative estimate on the size of the above in binary form is about 70 bytes. The above doesn't include the string constant with the text, "Hello, world!\n", nor does it include any of the aforementioned bookkeeping, but we can probably conclude from this that the size of a minimal binary shouldn't be more than 200 bytes. We're unfortunately still a long way from that!

Let's see if we can take this a step further by using compiler flags to remove information from our resulting binary. And after this, we can try to remove the remaining unnecessary sections in the binary by stripping it: 
```bash
$ gcc -Os -static -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-exceptions -fno-stack-protector -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -nostdlib -o hello_world_static_no_exception_handling hello_world_no_stdlib.c
$ strip -s hello_world_static_no_exception_handling
$ ls -l hello_world_static_no_exception_handling
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ajay users 8760 Jan 12 16:44 hello_world_static_no_exception_handling
```

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like all this reduced the size of the binary by very much. Let's try and find out what might be contributing to the still relatively large size of the binary. 
```bash
$ readelf -l hello_world_static_no_exception_handling

Looks like `strip -s` may not have been sufficient, given some of the seemingly unnecessary sections in the above output. Let's see if we can remove those sections from the binary and check whether it gets us anywhere: 
```bash
$ strip -s --remove-section=.note.gnu.property --remove-section=.note.gnu.build-id --remove-section=.comment hello_world_static_no_exception_handling
$ ls -l hello_world_static_no_exception_handling
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ajay users 8488 Jan 12 16:54 hello_world_static_no_exception_handling
```

Unfortunately, it looks like that only reduced the size of our binary by a few hundred bytes. If you run the `readelf` command again, you'll find that the same segments still exist but that the sections are gone: 
```bash
$ readelf -l hello_world_static_no_exception_handling

```

While the empty segments still take up some space in the resulting binary, in the form of program headers, the "Offset" value (0x0000000000000000) for each of those segments indicates that the data that was originally in those segments (the sections that were stripped) no longer exists. The real problem seems to be that the text segment (which contains our code) and the read-only data segment in the binary are at 0x1000 and 0x2000, respectively. Converting 0x2000 to decimal, we see that it's 8192. So it makes sense that the size of our binary after this whole process wasn't much larger than this value. Even though the amount of useful information contained in our binary is much less, the two useful segments of the binary are physically very far apart and contain a lot of padding. 

### Custom Linker Script

How are segments and sections laid out within an ELF binary? And is there a way to change it? Fortunately, we do have some control over this by using a custom linker script. Linker scripts themselves are farily complicated beasts and out of scope for this blog post, but hopefully a simple one should allow us to do what we want to do - at least to some extent. 

First, let's take a look at the default linker script: 
```bash
$ ld --verbose
GNU ld (GNU Binutils) 2.43.0                                                                                                                                                                  
  Supported emulations:                                                                                                                                                                       
   elf_x86_64                                                                                                                                                                                 
   elf32_x86_64                                                                                                                                                                               
   elf_i386                                                                                                                                                                                   
   elf_iamcu

  .dynstr         : { *(.dynstr) }
  .gnu.version    : { *(.gnu.version) }
...
```

It's quite long, but if you skim through it, you'll see some familiar names. The segments and sections that we saw before, when trying to inspect the program headers, for example, are defined here. 

Let's create a create a minimal custom linker script to see whether we can reduce the size of the executable even further. Without doing too much digging, you can come up with a linker script like the below: 
```ld
ENTRY(_start)

SECTIONS
{
	. = 0x10000;
	.text : { *(.text) }
	.rodata : { *(.rodata) }
}
```

What does this mean? First, it sets the entrypoint to `_start`, since that's the name of the function (symbol) that we want to use as the entrypoint (you'll notice that this is also the case for the default linker script, which makes sense). Then, it sets the current position in memory (the `.` is called the location counter) to be virtual address 0x10000. Then, it says that the `.text` section should start at that address, with the `.rodata` (read-only data) section following it. More information about linker scripts can be found [here](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Simple-Example.html). While the linker script doesn't say anything about where these sections should be placed in the ELF file, hopefully the default will give us what we want: 
```bash
$ gcc -Os -static -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-exceptions -fno-stack-protector -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -nostdlib -T hello_world.ld -o hello_world_static_no_exception_handling_custom_ld_script hello_world_no_stdlib.c
$ strip -s --remove-section=.note.gnu.property --remove-section=.note.gnu.build-id --remove-section=.comment hello_world_static_no_exception_handling_custom_ld_script
$ ls -l hello_world_static_no_exception_handling_custom_linker_script
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ajay users 4536 Jan 12 18:37 hello_world_static_no_exception_handling_custom_ld_script

Note that our linker script is stored in `hello_world.ld` and that we can specify to `gcc` that we'd like to use a custom linker script using the `-T` option. Through all of this, we were able to reduce the size of our binary to about half of what it was before this, which is progress at least, but still not as small as we'd like it to be. 

Let's look at the program headers in the resulting binary to see whether we can find some information from them: 
```bash
$ readelf -l hello_world_static_no_exception_handling_custom_ld_script

Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
Entry point 0x10000
There are 5 program headers, starting at offset 64

Program Headers:
  Type           Offset             VirtAddr           PhysAddr
                 FileSiz            MemSiz              Flags  Align
  LOAD           0x0000000000001000 0x0000000000010000 0x0000000000010000
                 0x0000000000000083 0x0000000000000083  R E    0x1000
  NOTE           0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000010020 0x0000000000000000
                 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000  R      0x8

 Section to Segment mapping:
  Segment Sections...
   00     .text._start .rodata._start.str1.1 
   01     
   02     
   03     
   04
```

Unfortunately, it looks like by default, the one non-trivial segment that we do have in this file can be found at offset 0x1000. Converting this to base 10, we get 4096, which explains the size of our binary. Still, we're left with a lot of padding that we want to get rid of. From here, one approach could be to try and set the file offset of our sections in the linker script, but a quick Google search didn't turn up any good results for me. It may be possible to set the file offset explicitly here, but I didn't try to dig further. 

### Custom ELF by Hand

Instead, let's construct the ELF binary by hand. After creating a simple helper script to convert a file with hex into binary, I proceeded to write the binary out in hex. What I came up with up is shown below: 
```
# Custom ELF binary for "Hello, world!"


# ELF header
7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 # 0000    ELF magic, 64-bit format, little endian, ELF version, System V target OS
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 # 0008    ABI version (ignored), padding bytes
02 00 3e 00 01 00 00 00 # 0010    ET_EXEC object file type, x86-64, ELF version
78 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 # 0018    Address of entry point
40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 # 0020    Start of program header table
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 # 0028    Start of section header table
00 00 00 00 40 00 38 00 # 0030    Flags that are architecture specific, ELF header size, program header table entry size
01 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 # 0038    Number of entries in program header table, section header table entry size, index of section header table that contains the section names


# Program header

## First entry (text segment)
01 00 00 00 05 00 00 00 # 0040    PT_LOAD (Loadable segment), PF_X & PF_R (executable and readable)
78 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 # 0048    Offset of segment in file
78 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 # 0050    Virtual address of the segment in memory
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 # 0058    Segment's physical address (not relevant in this case)
2e 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 # 0060    Size in bytes of the segment in the file image 
2e 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 # 0068    Size in bytes of the segment in memory 
00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 # 0070    Alignment - p_vaddr \equiv p_offset (modulo p_align)

# Text segment (virtual address of 0x400078)
b8 01 00 00 00          # 0078    mov    eax,0x1
48 8d 35 13 00 00 00    # 007D    lea    rsi,[rip+0x13]
ba 0e 00 00 00          # 0084    mov    edx,0xe
89 c7                   # 0089    mov    edi,eax
0f 05                   # 008B    syscall
b8 3c 00 00 00          # 008D    mov    eax,0x3c
31 ff                   # 0092    xor    edi,edi
0f 05                   # 0094    syscall
c3                      # 0096    ret

48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 77 # 0097    "Hello, W
6f 72 6c 64 21 0a 00    # 009F    orld!\n"
```

Note that anything after the `#` character within a line is a single-line comment and is ignored when creating the final ELF binary. Hopefully the comments explain what's going on here. And as mentioned above, here's the simple bash script I wrote to help convert the file with hex into a binary file: 
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# != 2 ]; then
	echo "Usage: $0 <infile> <outfile>"
	exit 1
fi

set -exuo pipefail

INFILE=$1
OUTFILE=$2
sed "s/#.*//" ${INFILE} | xxd -r -p - ${OUTFILE}
chmod 755 ${OUTFILE}
```

I won't explain it since I don't think it'll be very useful to the vast majority of readers. If you don't understand it, put it into an LLM and ask it to explain the script to you!

Let's see what the final size results are (the script is in a file called `hex_to_elf.sh` and the hex that I wrote is in a file called `hello_world.hex`): 
```bash
$ ./hex_to_elf.sh hello_world.hex hello_world_custom_elf
$ ls -l hello_world_custom_elf 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ajay users 166 Jan 12 18:53 hello_world_custom_elf
```

This seems like a success! Our binary contains pretty close to the bare minimum and is now only 166 bytes (less than our conservative estimate of 200 bytes)! As a last exercise, let's take a look at the segments in the executable: 
```bash
$ readelf -l hello_world_custom_elf 

Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
Entry point 0x400078
There is 1 program header, starting at offset 64

Program Headers:
  Type           Offset             VirtAddr           PhysAddr
                 FileSiz            MemSiz              Flags  Align
  LOAD           0x0000000000000078 0x0000000000400078 0x0000000000000000
                 0x000000000000002e 0x000000000000002e  R E    0x1000
```

As defined in our hex file, there's a single segment which is both readable and executable and is at offset 0x78 in our file (this is right after the ELF and program headers). The rest is also stuff we've defined in our hex file, but I won't go through it one by one. Again, see the comments in the hex file to better understand how I pieced it together. 

I feel like this exercise was useful to me, in that I was able to find some more about how ELF works under the hood. Hopefully you've found it useful too. Of course, there's much much more to it, and we've only scratched the surface. For example, we haven't touched dynamic linking at all. Maybe we can leave that as something to play with in the future! 

To conclude, if you'd like to play with any of the source for this yourself, you can find it [here](https://github.com/ajay1135/minimal-hello-world-elf/tree/main), along with a Makefile with targets that (sort of) correspond to the sections in this blog post. Thanks for reading!
